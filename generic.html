							<h1 class="major">More about me</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I have completed my diploma and undergraduation in Electrical Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai, India. I consider myself to be an affable, agnostic, and determined individual. Since childhood I have had a strong inclination towards science. My excellent performance in academics inspired me to pursue science as a career. I have completed one year of in-plant training at Larsen & Toubro Ltd commonly known as L&T. It has given me the opportunity to learn about giant industrial organization structure in early stage of my career. There, I got an opportunity to work on PLC programming, relay logics and control panel designing. I also completed summer internships during my undergrad at two separate government organizations which are RCF (Rashtriya Chemical & Fertilizers) and Electric Loco Shed Indian Railways. My internships have greatly expanded my practical knowledge and improved my ability to visualize and design. It has aided in my realization that not everything we learn in theory will be simple to put into practice. Not limiting myself to academics, I also take interest to cultivate and nurture my talents in the extracurricular activities like dance, music, and volunteer work.</p>
							<p>I have 2.7 years of work experience in Siemens Ltd., which is one of the giants in the Power and Energy Sector throughout the globe. Being in Siemens Ltd., I had deal with Medium Voltage products like switchgear panels, Ring Main Unit and Vacuum Circuit Breakers which are prevalent in present times. Working as a project execution engineer in ‘Medium Voltage’ division has also helped me to grind my technical expertise about the product and enhance my presentation skills.</p>
							<p>During my studies, I got increased interest in computer programming, therefore I took the IDEMI (A Government of India Society) certification course in C, C++, HTML, and Core JAVA programming and was able to receive an A+ grade certificate as a result. I firmly believe that computer science provides students with a foundation that enables them to adapt to new technologies and new ideas.
